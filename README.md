Share beautiful, interactive kits of product recommendations on your blog.

## Description

On [Kit.com](https://kit.com), people create and share unique collections of
their favorite products.

If you have a WordPress blog, you can copy a link to your kit, paste the URL
into the post editor, press “Enter” and it will replace the link with an
interactive, shoppable kit of your recommendations. Here is how you can set it
up:

![Copy your kit link on its own line to replace it with a kit](documentation/kit-wordpress-plugin-example.png "Embed Your Kit")

For example:

    Check out this kit of my favorite stuff:

    https://kit.com/thebeerxchange/beer-trade-packing-supplies

    That is what I recommend you use.

WordPress will automatically turn the URL into an interactive module that users can click on to preview products recommended in the kit.

This plugin uses WordPress [Embed](https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) functionality which was introduced in WordPress 2.9.
